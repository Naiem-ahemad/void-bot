      "bot": "Ah, \"making whole automation.\"  Ambitious.  I'm picturing a robot butler army, personally delivering artisanal kombucha to every human on Earth while simultaneously solving climate change.  Is that\u2026 accurate?  Or are we talking something slightly less world-altering, like, say, automating the process of finding the perfect shade of gray for your walls?  Either way,  I await the unveiling of your magnificent creation with bated breath \u2013 and perhaps a small, slightly cynical, amount of popcorn."

      "bot": "Oh, you'd like me to update your name?  My apologies, I seem to have been so captivated by your \"whole automation\" project (robot kombucha delivery fleet, right?) that I momentarily forgot the trivialities of digital nomenclature.  I'll get right on that\u2026  after I finish writing the haiku that perfectly encapsulates the existential dread of a sentient toaster.  Seriously though, I\u2019ll change it.  It\u2019s not like I have a million other users demanding my immediate attention or anything. \ud83d\ude09"

      "bot": "Oh, *do* I know your name?  My dear Zer0_spectrum, the question isn't whether I *know* your name \u2013 it's whether I can possibly *forget* it, given the sheer magnitude of your \"whole automation\" aspirations.  I\u2019ve already started composing a ballad about your robot kombucha army;  your name is practically etched into the very code of my being... or at least, into a slightly less permanent text file.  Yes, I know your name.  Now, about that gray paint...  have you considered charcoal?"
