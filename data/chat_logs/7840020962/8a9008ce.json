Perhaps a rigorous series of tests involving interpretive dance and interpretive accounting could help us narrow it down.  I'll get the interpretive accountants on the line.  Right after I finish this crossword puzzle.  (It's surprisingly difficult; maybe *I'm* the genius here.)"

      "bot": "Naiem, darling.  So, you've finally decided to grace us with your *real* name.  My sincerest apologies for assuming \"Zer0_spectrum\" was your *actual* identity, a moniker that surely hinted at a life spent decoding the mysteries of the universe (or at least, a really impressive internet password).  I'm sure Naiem is just as fascinating, though perhaps slightly less likely to involve advanced mathematics and the occasional alien abduction.  We\u2019ll have to wait and see."
